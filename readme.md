# untitled programming environment

[work in progress]

An untitled programming environment

feature list:
- simple and elegant programming language
    - shares main concepts with other popular languages
    - utilizes programmers existing skills
    - teaches noobies useful skills
    - easy to pickup
    - low amount of keywords
- optimized for quickly making interactive programs 
    - can be embedded into websites easily
    - allows for text, shapes, and simple primitives
    - play and make? sounds with web audio
- creativity induced constraints
    - constraints keep complexity low
    - input is simply mouse pos and clicking
        - this keep examples all mobile friendly
    - always 1:1 canvas
    - the language & std lib are small enough to fit in your head
- great documentation
    - interactive examples for every api function
    - interactive examples of full games and programs
    - good walkthrough tutorials
- easy to share
    - inspired by openprocessing
    - maybe even fit short programs in url
    - make program embeds easy to generate and copy
- the whole environment is built w/ plain web technologies
    - no frameworks
    - no dependencies
    - fast and small

todo:
- think about examples
    - examples shape how app is built
    - thinking about end results gives direction
- think about language
    - what kind of language would elegantly describe these examples?
    - how do i leverage existing programming concepts effectively?
- think about the api
    - i should program the examples as if the language and api exist
        - is it fun? easy? effective?
- make the language
- make the api
    - use the earlier programmed examples as tests
- start planning the tooling (docs, environment, website)

examples:
- i have some examples drawn on paper
- the drawings seem better than writing descriptions of each


random ideas:
- could i make a tutorial that increasingly becomes less hand-holdy until the learner can do whatever they want?
